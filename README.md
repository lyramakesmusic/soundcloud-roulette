# soundcloud roulette

Randomly creates shortened soundcloud links (format: `https://on.soundcloud.com/h5AtN`) and loads them as an embed if they resolve.

## Install and run:

You will need to install Go, and download these files into a folder. `cd` into the folder and run `go run .`, then open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

The included .exe file is compiled directly from source and safe to run if you don't have Go installed, but it is **always safer** to compile it yourself!! Running random .exes is usually not a very good idea.
